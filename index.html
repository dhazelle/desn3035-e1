    <h1>My First Microsite!!</h1>
    <p>This exercise at first started out well, I remembered some things from my previous experience with the graphic design program I attended. However I had a few issues with getting familiar with GitHub and remembering how to commit to changes. I also need to remember to watch out for any spelling errors which can cause problems with my codes. During my time in graphic design I was able to use Figma to create and design a mobile app. I hope during this program I will be able to learn how to code my app and launch it if I ever decide to take that path.</p>
